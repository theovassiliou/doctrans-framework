# 7. Inventory of external services used

Date: 2021-01-26

## Status

Accepted

Amends [5. Inventory of used libraries and tools](0005-inventory-of-used-libraries-and-tools.md)

## Context

We have to track which external services are being used by our reference implementation.

## Decision

We are maintaining a list of services that the reference implementation is using.

## Consequences

- We are using the same list as in [5. Inventory of used libraries and tools](0005-inventory-of-used-libraries-and-tools.md)
- For each service we might have to reconsider the usage, and or modify it
