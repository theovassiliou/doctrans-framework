# 9. Tests for all framework functionality

Date: 2021-01-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

DTA is a framework that evolves. We might break things we might improve things. Tests might help us
to define the current status.

## Decision

Providing unit tests for public functionality

## Consequences

- We can identify more easily the current status of the implementations.
- We are focusing on automatically executable unit tests
