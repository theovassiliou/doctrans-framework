# 13. Providing a sample web-frontend for using DTA services

Date: 2021-02-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As DTA is an experimentation platform and thus we would like to have some easy to gain insights.  For example seeing which services, together with some details are registered at a eureka server. Also, you might want to use some functions. In addition, we would
like to use golang as main, potentially only programming language also for this task.

## Decision

We will create a web front end and vugu.org to design the web-frontend.

## Consequences

A website will be implemented as WebAssembly.
